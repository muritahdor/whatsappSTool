        <p>Small tool to display chats from the Android msgstore.db.crypt5 and .crypt7 database.</p>

		<p class="screenshot"></p>

		<p class="download"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andreas-mausch/whatsapp-viewer/releases/latest">Download here</a></p>

<h3>How to use:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download msgstore.db.crypt5 from your Android phone (located at <span class="file">/sdcard/WhatsApp/Databases</span>)</li>
<li>Open WhatsApp Viewer</li>
<li>File -&gt; Open -&gt; Select file</li>
<li>Enter account name. This must be the same Google account name used on your phone. If you have more than one account, try the first one. Make sure you enter the whole email address as account name. If you have trouble, sometimes leaving the account name empty is known to work.</li>
<li>Click on a chat to show the messages.</li>
</ol><p>Currently only text and image messages are supported (no audio, gps).
You cannot see bigger images because only thumbnails are stored in the database.
You see cryptic phone numbers because account names or details are not stored in the database (no support for wa.db yet).</p>

<p>This release is not stable and known to crash sometimes. Sorry.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p class="question">Where can I get the msgstore.db database file?</p>
		<p>Plug your phone into your computer (USB), go to the folder WhatsApp/Databases and download the file from there.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p class="question">How can I decrypt .crypt7?</p>
		<p>First of all you need root access to your device. Currently I don't know a solution for non-rooted devices, so if you really want to decrypt your database please use your favorite internet search engine for rooting instructions.</p>
		<p>When you got root access, you can download the file from the system memory at <span class="file">/data/data/com.whatsapp/files/key</span>. Personally, I use MyPhoneExplorer for this task and I can really recommend this tool.</p>
		<p>Once you got both, the .crypt7 and key file, use the menu File->Decrypt .crypt7, select your files and press OK.</p>
		<p>The decrypted file should be in the same folder, you can now open it in WhatsApp Viewer.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p class="question">How can I decrypt .crypt5?</p>
		<p>.crypt5 files are, as the name implies, encrypted database backups. The key is combined of some numbers and your personal email address. Usually this is the first account on Settings->Accounts on your phone and is a Google-Mail account. Make sure you enter the whole email address as account name. If you have trouble, sometimes leaving the account name empty is known to work.</p>
		<p>So in order to decrypt the file, click File->Decrypt .crypt5, select your file and type the email address. Now you should see a confirmation and the decrypted database on your disk.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p class="question">Error: could not load chat list sqlite error 11 database disk image is malformed</p>
		<p>Sometimes WhatsApp creates a malformed backup and you need to repair it. Currently there is no automatic repair option in WhatsApp Viewer, so you need to do it manually.</p>
		<p>You need sqlite installed on your computer and run these two lines from command prompt:</p>
		<p class="code">echo .dump | sqlite3 msgstore.db > temp.sql</p>
		<p class="code">echo .quit | sqlite3 -init temp.sql repaired.db</p>
		<p>Now you can load repaired.db with WhatsApp Viewer.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p class="question">I get error XYZ, the conversation is not displayed, the app crashes without any error message, ...</p>
		<p>Sorry.</p>
		<p>Please consider this app as beta, I can't test all variations of WhatsApp backups out there.</p>
		<p>However, if you don't mind and would like to improve the experience for all users you can send me the file you have problems with and I try my best to help you or fix errors. I understand a backup file contains a lot of personal information most users don't want to share, however debugging is much easier when you can reproduce the problem, so it would help me a lot. I am not interested in your personal data and will delete all the files you send me from my disks after the bugfix.</p>
